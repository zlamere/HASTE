HATS v0.7.04 (Program name is also referred to as 'HASTE' and 'FASTEN' in source)

This version is depreciated and unsupported.  Binaries and source are provided for continuity and historical documentation, but support (including build instructions, preprocessor directives, etc) will not be provided

The source includes non-standard Fortran and Intel compiler-specific implementations.  More recent versions (v1.0+) are moving toward better Fortran standard compliance (Fortran 2008), and discarding compiler-specific practices and language extensions.
